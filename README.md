# GraphColoring

GraphColoring is a software project that solves the graph coloring problem, ensuring that no two connected nodes share the same color. This project implements various graph coloring algorithms and can be used to visualize and test different graph structures.

## Features
- **Node and Edge Management:** Add, remove, and manage nodes and edges in the graph.
- **Graph Coloring Algorithms:** Implements algorithms such as the Greedy Coloring Algorithm.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the graph and the coloring process.
- **Conflict Detection:** Ensures no two connected nodes have the same color.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/GraphColoring.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd GraphColoring`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` (depending on the technology stack)
4. Run the project: `npm start` or `python main.py`

## Usage
1. Load or create a graph.
2. Select a graph coloring algorithm.
3. Execute the algorithm to color the graph.
4. View the results and check for conflicts.
